# Numpy-only 2-layer Neural Network for Binary Classification

A 2-layer neural network for binary classification built using Numpy only. 

The neural_net file contains a neural net class with a range of different inbuilt function allowing you to define how many nodes each layer has. Can specify learning rate and number of epochs. 

Uses hard-coded ReLU and sigmoid functions. 

Performs random weight initialization, forward propagation, backwards propagation and cross-entropy loss calculation.

Next goals are to expand it to allow for multi-class prediction and more layers.
